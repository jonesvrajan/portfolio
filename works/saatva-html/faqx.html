                        <h4>1) Are your representatives on commission?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Saatva shuns commissions as we give honest guidance for your next mattress purchase be it from us or another source. A commissioned employee makes more money when he/she sells you and that leads to potentially pressured or misleading talk. Never at Saatva.
                        </p>

                        <h4>2) How does your 30 day return policy work?</h4>
                        <p>
                            At Saatva, we are all about luxury, value and convenience. From the day you receive your Saatva mattress, you will have 30 days to sleep on it before you decide to keep it or not. (30 day trial begins on date of delivery, not date of purchase). If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with our mattress, we will come pick it up and refund all your money excluding the original delivery charge. There will be "absolutely" no restocking fees or pick up charges. Because of our "no store" philosophy, we know we're able to exceed your expectations by delivering you a mattress that would normally cost you about $1,200 more if purchased at an actual mattress store.

                        <h4>3) Will a Saatva mattress work on my existing box spring/foundation?</h4>
                        <p>
                            We would generally recommend purchasing our entire system, both mattress and foundation. But if your box spring/foundation is in very good condition, meaning it's sturdy and has absolutely no sagging, it should work fine. Your mattress warranty remains in place even when using your foundation/ box spring.
                        </p>

                        <h4>4) Although the site recommends your 11 1/2" mattress for platform beds, is it ok to use the 14 1/2" thickness on a platform as well?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Yes! We only recommend the slimmer version if your platform has a very low headboard. The recommendation is purely from an aesthetic standpoint.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>5) I have a narrow staircase, and I'm interested in a queen set. I know your king sets come standard with a split foundation. Do you offer a split foundation for your queen sets?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Yes. If you have a narrow staircase, we recommend ordering the split queen foundation, which has an additional charge of $35.00. There is absolutely no difference in feel between a regular foundation and a split foundation. Split foundations are made for delivery purposes only.

                        <h4>6) How high are the metal frames that the mattress and foundation sit on?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our metal frames are 7" high.

                        <p>
                            Absolutely! The price of delivery includes total set up and placement of your mattress set, including the metal frame.

                            If you would like the delivery team to take your old mattress away from your property there is a charge of $35.00. If you need this service please fill in the check box next to "Mattress Removal" on your shopping cart page.

                        <p>
                            The Saatva mattress is hand crafted in 10 independent American factories along with 30 American fulfillment centers delivering the Saatva into your home. Each Saatva mattress is built according to our strict proprietary specifications, with the use of our organic cotton, our bio-based foams and our recycled steel rod coil units resulting in the best quality at the best price when measured objectively.

                        <p>
                            Saatva Foundations are made of North American Spruce hardwoods providing a durable platform style support system for the Saatva mattress. They also contain our bio-based foams and are also covered in our organic cotton.

                    <li>
                        <h4>12) What's the difference between a Euro pillow top mattress and a standard pillow top mattress?</h4>
                        <p>
                            A euro pillow top is the most recent development in pillow top mattresses. Like standard pillow tops, it also consists of extra layers of wadding materials added to the top of the mattress. But, in a euro pillow top design these materials are inserted under the outer cover of the mattress to create a cleaner/neater look instead of it being stitched to the top of the mattress. Because of this advanced design, a euro pillow top should retain its shape for longer then a standard pillow top.

                        <h4>13) How are your mattresses constructed?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our mattresses are built with 2 coil units, which is why they're considered Ultra Premium. (Please refer to Our Mattress page)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>14) How long will your mattress last?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our mattresses are built to last 10 to 15 years with normal usage.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>15) Are your mattresses flame retardant?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our mattresses and foundations are all flame retardant. We use a "NATURAL THISTLE BARRIER". This is a plant based fiber mesh "Natural Thistle", made from mainly wood pulp and bonded with a small amount of polyester. This creates a flame retardant barrier without the use of harmful chemicals. There are no sprays applied to a Saatva mattress.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>16) Do your mattresses off-gas?</h4>
                        <p>
                            We do "no" off gassing where we manufacture our products. There is a small amount of off gassing done at our suppliers facility where the foam is made. All foams must be stable when they are shipped to our manufacturing partners.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>17) Are there natural markings on your organic cotton covering?</h4>
                        <p>
                            As beautiful and healthy as 100% organic ticking is, it is impossible to avoid natural markings that might appear. They are a result of the best organic cleansing process in finishing your product. Chemicals will not be used at Saatva to eradicate those natural markings. They are completely harmless and only affirm the use of healthy organic material.
                        </p>

                        <h4>18) What mattresses compare to Saatva?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Please refer to our mattress comparison chart.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>19) What height foundation do I need to fit my bed skirt?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The bed skirt goes over the foundation and under the mattress. Common bed skirts are 15" high. That means our standard 8" foundation and a standard 7" metal frame work well.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>20) Are your mattresses 100% organic?</h4>
                        <p>
                            We are not 100% organic. We have taken a green initiative, which means our foams are bio based using at least 30% soy or corn oil. Additionally, we used recycled steel, a plant based natural thistle, and an organic cotton covering.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>21) How is the 3" difference made up between the 11.5" and the 14.5"?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The lower steel base coil unit in our 11.5" model has two less turns. The 11.5" and the 14.5" models have the identical coil count, the difference is only within the height of the lower coil unit making this purely an aesthetic decision.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>22) Are the mattress dimensions listed 100% exact?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Standard published finished sizes of our hand crafted mattresses are estimated when measured from tape to tape in length and width. Actual dimensions may vary in total from standard finished sizes to allow for proper fitting of sheets and linens. Mattress heights may vary slightly due to the pre-compression of raw materials.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>23) Why do the heights vary slightly?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The reason is that the top portion of our mattresses are handcrafted, so the cover is pulled and set in place by hand before it is sewn in. Additionally, when the bio-based foams that we use are taken out of their sealed bags, they need some time to settle to their final position. Again, this can simply cause a slight variation to the height.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>24) What are the exact components used in a Saatva Mattress?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Organic Cotton backed with hypoallergenic fibers, plant based Natural Thistle which consists of wood pulp and a polyester bonding agent, Cotton, Plant based foams of 30% soy and corn oil coupled with polyurethane and Dacron, recycled steel springs/ coils, bio based visco memory foam, rayon and Kevlar thread.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>25) What is the ILD of our foams..?</h4>
                        <p>
                            They range from 18 to 30 lbs of pressure....The ILD is the "Internal Load Deflection"...This describes the amount of pressure needed to create a 25% indentation into the foam.
                        </p>

                        <h4>26) Are there stores where I can try out the bed?</h4>
                        <p>
                            We sell our mattresses directly through our website only. We don't believe trying a bed out for a few minutes in a store will determine how well you will sleep on it. This is proven by the horrific stories found online from people who had bought their mattress at a store and were not happy with their choice. This common scenario results in a fight over exchange fees, restocking fees, penalty fees and additional pick up fees. At Saatva, we have a very friendly home trial, where the only cost you would be responsible for if you're not happy with our bed is the original delivery fee. No gimmicks, no nonsense. We offer several pages on our website where you can see 'objective measures of comparison' so as to understand the quality level and value we offer.

                        <p>
                            Saatva took an ultra-premium approach to its bedding manufacturing by using a dual support coil system. Dual coil support systems are not only more supportive and comfortable than single coil structures; they are much more durable as the strain of the body's weight is distributed among two series of coils. This leads to higher quality sleep for a much longer period of time. Also coil on coil beds tend to have 50-100% more coil units than traditional standard premium beds. However, because of the cost of production, coil-on-coil units rarely, if ever, sell for less than $2500, and are more often in beds in the $3500 plus range. When our customers get a Saatva bed they immediately feel the 'coil on coil' difference.

                        <h4>28) Why did you choose Bonnell Coils for your Lower Base Layer?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Bonnell coils are the industry standard for mattresses as they offer support and durability, however they sacrifice comfort. As such they are usually in average priced beds. However as a lower layer function in a two-coil system they provide a perfect, durable, base support layer. (Essentially Bonnells are not great as the "only' layer, but in more advanced dual-coil beds are great for "support" layers). Additionally Saatva went beyond traditional Bonnell coils in its bottom support layer by using one of the thickest Gauge steel coils in the industry (13 gauge coils), far above traditional bonnell coil thickness. It forms what we feel is an ideal base of support.

                        <h4>29) What are the low profile coils that are used in your Upper Coil Unit?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Low profile coils compose the top layer of the Saatva mattress. We use the highest quality individually pocketed coils in our Comfort layer surrounded by the highest quality foam available on the market. Given the quality and number of coils we use, our low profile coils cost us around 4X the cost of a latex or memory foam layer used in other comparably priced beds. However, our mattress experts (and our backs) decided that the cost was worth the far greater combination of flexibility, support, durability (it greatly helps to avoid sagging), and comfort that comes with a dual-coil construction. It was a choice driven by quality.

                        <h4>30) Are you GMO free?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The organic cotton in our covers is GMO free by nature of the organic label. All bio-based foams have a derivative of soy as the bio component. GMO free soy is a specialty item which carries a premium in foodstuffs and is therefore not used in TDI or Polyol production of foam.
