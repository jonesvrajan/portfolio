                            <label>Ron Rudzin: </label>Clearly, we have shown customers there is a way to buy luxury mattress sets that would normally cost $2,400 in a store for less then $1,099. 
                            We are the only pure online luxury mattress company. Because of our "no store" philosophy, we are not burdened with the tremendous costs and expenses that are incurred by 
                            traditional retailers, such as rent, store maintenance, utilities and excessive salaries/commissions. Our “internet only” business model is the most efficient in our industry 
                            and equally as important, we have also eliminated all the confusion associated with mattress buying.

                            <label>Ron Rudzin:</label> I didn't want to be involved with cheap mattresses. The dissatisfaction rate is too high. We knew that we had to offer a very strong return policy for 
                            customers buying online, and I was only comfortable doing so with the knowledge I was sending a product that far exceeds my customers’ expectations. It took 2 <sup> 1/2 </sup>years to develop 
                            the Saatva mattress. We did our research and developed the 3 basic comfort levels that are sold in the luxury market, featuring our "Luxury Firm" which is modeled after the comfort 
                            level used in the finest hotels in the world, where their goal is to ensure every guest gets a great night sleep. Additionally, we have taken a true green initiative on our product line.
                            Because our customers are financially savvy, they immediately understand the business model we've built and see the value we can offer. We built a company, and a mattress, 
                            that would satisfy this customer base, both from a service and quality standpoint. The only way Saatva can adhere to these principles is in the luxury market. 
                            We make every experience with us a positive one. You just can't do that selling cheap products.

                            <label>Ron Rudzin:</label> I'm surprised people think trying a bed out in a store for 2 minutes gives a true indication of how they'll sleep on it. I say, 
                            sleep on our bed for 30 days, and then decide if it's right for you. Millions of people have walked out of the finest luxury hotels in the world revitalized with an 
                            incredible night’s sleep. The satisfaction rate on true luxury products is remarkably high, and that's what we strive for. Our mattresses are built with a unique coil 
                            on coil construction. The universal comfort on our "Luxury Firm" is achieved through the top portion of our mattress which is designed with individual pocketed coils, 
                            allowing the mattress to contour perfectly to any body shape, weight or sleeping position. This is coupled with the use of the finest materials available in luxury 
                            mattresses today. We know our customers will be thrilled with our bed. That’s why we offer such a strong return policy.

                        <p>
                            <label>Ron Rudzin:</label> Internet savvy, fiscally responsible people who have a complete understanding of how they benefit buying on the web. Additionally, 
                            our customers have a history of disliking the mattress store shopping experience. The confusion and the expense pushed them into looking for an alternative. 
                            Once these customers buy from Saatva, they become customers for life. They'll never have to walk into a mattress store again.

                            <label>Ron Rudzin:</label> Most importantly, we wanted to make sure that every customer feels that they are dealing with a company that is totally transparent. 
                            We do a variety of marketing for Saatva, but word of mouth is the key to success in this new world of sharing information. Additionally, we wanted the site to 
                            be easy to navigate. We just want to keep things simple. We know we have an extraordinary product, and we believe we have made it simple for our customers 
                            to come to that conclusion.

                            <label>Ron Rudzin:</label> It's that we have developed a truly efficient business model, which benefits our clients, our employees and of course, our company. 
                            Zappos claims to deliver "happiness", at Saatva, we claim to deliver "comfort and happiness." Additionally, we have taken a true green initiative. We have built 
                            a national company while maintaining a very low carbon footprint, in an industry that generally lends no hand to that cause.
                            I'm also very proud of our distribution and manufacturing teams, as well as our web, tech and office staffs. We are all on the same page in this ever lasting 
                            effort to make buying a luxury mattress easy and affordable.

                    <li class="question int-width-row"><p><label>Sky Social Media:</label> So let me ask again, people really buy a mattress without lying on it first?</p></li>

                        <p>
                            <label>Ron Rudzin:</label> Let me answer by giving you a visual: We have 28 fulfillment centers strategically located throughout the US and they are supported by 9 factories. 
                            So yes we sell a lot of mattresses. Although this is a unique way of selling a mattress the consumer is thrilled with the entire process. 
                            You don't have to take my word for it, just look at the vast number of reviews for us all over the internet.
